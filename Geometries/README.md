## Geometries

**All structures in this folder have been obtained at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVPD level of theory. The coordinates are in .xyz format.**

This folder is organized as follows: 

- **Acetate**: All the geometries used for the main text and the Supplementary Information (SI) that involve the different mechanisms analyzed for MDNI and MNI. The file names are given according to the order followed in the main text or SI.

- **Glutamate**: All the geometries used in the discussion of the most important transition structures (migration and cyclization). They are divided in four sub-folders according to the structures taken into account.

- **MDNI-Et**: The two structures needed to calculate the Gibbs' free energy of migration for a caged ethyl group.

- **TD-DFT**: The structures used for TD-DFT calculations. They are the same structures as in the Glutamate folders.

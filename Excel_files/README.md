## Energetic calculations, quantum yield and DFT benchmark.

**This folder collects the energetic data used throughout the main text and the Supplementary Information files.**

These files are organized in a similar way. We discuss the "results_MDNI.xlsx" file as an example.

Within the Excel files, we reported the energetic results for all the functionals tested. The geometries have been obtained at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVPD level of theory, while single-point energy calcylations have been performed with various functionals  (ωB97X-D, M11, MN15, CAM-B3LYP, LC-ωHPBE, DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), and ωB97M-V) and the def2-TZVP basis set. The results are reported in different sheets named according to the functional's name. 



**Spin-Orbit Coupling (SOC) calculations**

For the caged glutamate ("results_Glu.xlsx"), in addition to the results reported per functional, we also included a sheet called "QY_Calculations". The SOC results are reported there, together with the estimated kinetic constants of intersystem crossing.

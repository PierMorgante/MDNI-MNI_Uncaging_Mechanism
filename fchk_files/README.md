## Formatted Check-point files for M(D)NI compounds.

**This folder collects the formatted check-point files (.fchk) for the MDNI-Glu, MNI-Glu, α-MDNI-Glu and α-MNI-Glu molecules.**** 


They have been obtained with the ωB97X-D functional and the def2-TZVP basis set employing a Lebedev integration grid with 99 radial and 590 angular points (99,590). Time-Dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations have been performed using the [Tamm-Dancoff](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261499011495?via%3Dihub) approximation. We calculated the first ten singlet excited states and the first ten triplet excited states. 

All the above calculations have been performed with the [Q-Chem program](https://www.q-chem.com).

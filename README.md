This GitHub repository collects all the material used as Supporting Information to this article. It is divided into different folders:

* **Excel_files**: This folder collects all the energetic results for all structures considered.

* **fchk_files**: This folder collects the formatted check-point files from the Q-Chem program used to analyze the orbital characters for all the states involved in the TD-DFT calculations.

* **Figures**: This folder includes the original files used to generate the graphical elements in the main text and in the SI.

* **Geometries**: This folder collects all the geometries for the reaction mechanisms studied. They are formatted as .xyz files.
